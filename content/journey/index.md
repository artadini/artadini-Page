## About Niko Artadi

Peruvian-German 🇵🇪-🇩🇪 stranded in Berlin 🐻.

Over the past eight years, I've navigated a dynamic career, alternating between scaling businesses in frontliner roles and delving into data across diverse industries—from Market Research to Fintech. This unique blend of experience has afforded me a comprehensive understanding of both the commercial and analytical facets, enabling me to drive growth and innovation at the intersection of business and data.

With a diverse background in sales, I specialize in crafting efficient pipelines, strategically expanding sales teams, and cultivating customer growth and retention strategies.

My focus extends to enhancing CRM systems and refining processes in sales, customer success, marketing, and support. Operations is my forte, and I thrive on elevating it to new heights by seamlessly blending the power of insights with decisive action.

## What I'm doing now

I'm in a journey to step up the CRM game of the companies I work for. I strongly believe that a CRM is the heart of the company, it should pump the business with customer insights while supporting a scalable framework for commercial frontliners to work in.
