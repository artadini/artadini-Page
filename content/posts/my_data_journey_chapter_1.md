Hey there! Welcome to a series of chapters on how my journey in data started and continues to develop. I'll be sharing my ongoing experiences because data is a constantly evolving topic. Stay tuned for the journey ahead!

# My thoughts on data
Data has become a cornerstone on which I guide my decision making and reflect on my path in life. Data is more than a career for me, itâ€™s a journey.
I should start with my point of view on data. Letâ€™s walk down the philosophical street for a moment. 

Data, initially intangible, is ever-present in our livesâ€”embedded in everything we do and produced by the world. To harness its power effectively, focus on these key aspects:
Gain domain knowledge for context; that's where the value lies.
Learn how to collect and refine data for actionable insights, shaping decisions and impactful actions.
Understand that data is about people and making a meaningful impact in their lives. Engage with them, understand their needs. That's crucial!

I hope this small introduction resonates with you and inspires you to start your own journey.
Ask yourself this:

>What does data mean to you?

# Uncertainty boosted me
The truth is, I've never really been sure about the next step I will take, but Iâ€™ve always dared to take a step forward and adjust while walking.

My journey started with the decision to study Business IT in Germany. I found myself in an auditorium filled with people experienced in `C`, `C#`, `C++`, `Python`, `JS`, while I had never touched a programming language. "Great choice, Niko!" I thought, feeling overwhelmed.

Guess what happened next? I quit after the second week, feeling clueless about my next steps. However, I found the perfect solution: a spot at [Business School Pforzheim](https://businesspf.hs-pforzheim.de/en/) to focus solely on business studies. I reassured myself, thinking it shouldn't be that hard; it's business, after all. Little did I know, it was the start of a data-driven journey.

# When time the data lightbulb really turned on
Fast forward five years, a couple of beer semesters in-between, and some impactful life events â€“ it's 2018, and I'm working in Moscow for a small international CRM company trying to make it big in the States, leading the international sales division. Yes, that's right, Sales was the first place that embraced me.

My boss at the time was big on making data-driven decisions. The solution we offered could sift through the noise of dirty data and precisely pinpoint sales representative performance. We could analyze key metrics, like call time, emails sent, value of closed deals, and closure rate â€“ features similar to many CRMs today. Notably, we were poking companies like HubSpot and Pipedrive for business.

That moment sparked my interest in the power of data. Despite my unfamiliarity with Python, I started using GSheet as my primary tool. I mastered leveraging data to challenge my reports and management, proposing optimal actions even in uncertain situations. My boss, valuing data-driven decisions, instilled a sense of security in our conversations, trusting the process. Which was big for the culture I was working in!

# The moment I plateaued
Fast forward again, after making some life decisions, I found myself changing both country and role. In Berlin, I worked as a Customer Success Executive in the market research industry. As a side note, if you ever want to make good, relaxed money, it's a great industry to be in! However, little did I know at the time, decisions were primarily made based on good old gut feelings.

For sure, that wasnâ€™t enough for me, with the limited CRM capabilities we had. I tried to forecast. The company was stepping up to become a corporate and more of these methodologies were in demand.

My trick was just checking the numbers from the last 12, 6, and 3 months. Through my business understanding I was able to estimate an increase or decrease of 5-10%. I'd make a modestly positive projection. Surprisingly, I always hit my target with this simple approach.

It's worth noting that, despite being one of the smallest spenders initially within my two years tenue at the company, I increased my [Share of Wallet](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/share-of-wallet.asp) from around ~120k EUR to an impressive 300k EUR. This foundation played a crucial role, as two of these customers later generated almost at 1 million EUR in [Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/arr.asp) for the company.

# â€¦ and then I took a leap of faith
I wasnâ€™t happy in the company so I decided to move on. It was already almost 3 years since I had finished my business studies and I was super unhappy with my salary. Take into consideration, Berlin had one of the lowest salaries in Germany at that time (That was 2019, but here is a [comparison on the current ranges](https://www.gehalt.de/beruf/customer-success-manager).).
I was pretty confused and wasnâ€™t sure if I should do a masters, do a course in coding to step up my game and become a frontend developer or or orâ€¦

During that time, I stumbled upon [Range, by David Epstein](https://davidepstein.com/the-range/). An incredible, life changing book that pushed me to find a masters to study data science in Madrid, Spain.
My alma mater, [Instituto Empresarial (IE)](https://www.ie.edu/) gave me the tools, knowledge and inspiration to be prepared for my life.


During this period, I secured a new job leading Customer Success in the Customer Experience sector for small companies in Germany in my dream industry, Fintech. Concurrently, I embarked on my master's journey.

In 17 months of work, intense study, a few beers in between, meeting amazing people with diverse perspectives on life, and experiencing several brain-melting moments. I acquired hard skills like SQL, Python; and a grasp of modern data warehouse technologies, along with targeted domain research, and much more! Yet, the most crucial skill I gained was networking.

# Stepping up my data journey
With a new perspective on my career still in Sales, I wasn't content. I decided to explore other opportunities, delving into various data challenges. Over five years in Sales, I realized the value of cold calling and prospecting individuals to discuss data. Despite my modest SQL skills at the time, I tackled numerous data challenges and found success.

After a few months of exploration, I struck a golden ratio with a stakeholder, marking the true beginning of my data career. I transitioned into the role of a Business Solution Analyst, tasked with improving our Customer Success Platform. This involved integration, workflow optimization, and the "best" part of my dayâ€”addressing tickets for commercial frontliners like sales representatives and customer success managers. (That last part was a jokeâ€”sarcasm doesn't always translate well in writing.)
